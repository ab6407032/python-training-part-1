# üêç Python Beginner Assignments

Welcome to the **Python Beginner Assignments** repository! This collection of `.py` files is designed to help absolute beginners understand and practice the fundamentals of Python programming. Each script in this repository represents a standalone task that focuses on specific programming concepts such as input/output, conditionals, type handling, string manipulation, and basic arithmetic operations.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository contains 18 Python script files, each solving a different assignment. Below is a summary of each assignment:
